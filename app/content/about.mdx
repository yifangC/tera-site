# **Yi-Fang** _Tera_ Cheng

Hi there! Welcome to my personal webpage.

I'm a third year Ph.D. student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu)'s Lingusitics Department, where I work with Prof. [Daniel J. Olson](https://danieljolson.weebly.com) in [Purdue Bilingualism Lab (PBL)](https://purduebilingualismlab.weebly.com). My research interest broadly lies in Phonetics and Bilingualism, with a focus on short-term interference. Currently, I am exploring cross-lingusitic activation through a large Mandarinâ€“English code-switching speech corpus.

I received my Bachelor's degrees in both Music and English from [National Taiwan Normal University](https://en.ntnu.edu.tw) and my Master's degree in Linguistics from Purdue University.
I worked previously as a pianist before joining Purdue. You can find me as a pianist [here](static/pdf/piano.pdf).
