# **Yi-Fang** Cheng

Hi there! Welcome to my personal webpage.

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student with a graduate certificate in Applied Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu)'s Lingusitics Department, where I also earned my MA in Linguistics. I work with Prof. [Daniel J. Olson](https://danieljolson.weebly.com) in [Purdue Bilingualism Lab (PBL)](https://purduebilingualismlab.weebly.com) on Bilingualism and Phonetics. My primary research line focuses on the temporal dynamics of cross-linguistic interference.

Because bilinguals manage multiple languages within a single cognitive system, these are some of the questions I’m trying to answer using both lab-based experimental designs and computational approaches on neural network models:

- How do bilingual speakers' languages interact with each other?
- How do bilingual speakers’ acoustic patterns shift as they switch between languages (code-switch)?
- How can these moment-to-moment acoustic changes be measured and modeled to reveal the underlying processes that guide bilingual speech production?

I work with Prof. [Elsayed Issa](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~esissa/) in [Computational Linguistic @ Purdue (CLAP)](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/research/clai/index.html) on Human–AI interaction. Our work on AI in language learning is supported by the NSF National I-Corps program.

I received my Bachelor's degrees in both Music and English from [National Taiwan Normal University](https://en.ntnu.edu.tw). I worked previously as a pianist before joining Purdue. You can find me as a pianist [here](static/pdf/pianist.pdf). And some past recordings [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V96txIxYYKg) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AGmh8unxhEXgmE1KmB0MtgouVE21dSlr/view).

When I’m not linguisting, I’m probably off befriending animals;\)
